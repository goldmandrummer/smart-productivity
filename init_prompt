A Python CLI task manager app that sort of mimics a chatbot interaction but with preset prompts and using text files in system storage for persistence. It has an infinite loop to prompt the user for input until they choose to terminate the script. Upon starting the script, the user is presented with the 3 tasks with the highest priority scores followed by the options for actions they can perform (e.g. adding a task, updating a task, etc.). It handles due dates, durations, priority scores, and recurring tasks.
