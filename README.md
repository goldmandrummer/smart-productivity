Let's start by defining the structure of our project. We will have the following files:

- `main.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will handle the user interaction and call the appropriate functions based on user input.
- `task_manager.py`: This file will contain the `TaskManager` class which will handle all task related operations such as adding, updating, deleting tasks etc.
- `task.py`: This file will contain the `Task` class which will represent a task.
- `storage.py`: This file will contain the `Storage` class which will handle all file related operations such as reading and writing tasks to a file.
- `requirements.txt`: This file will contain all the dependencies required for our project.

Let's start by creating the `Task` class:

task.py
