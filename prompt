The current code gives the error "ValueError: unconverted data remains:  00:00:00" because the parsing does not handle the time component of the datetime string that's in the task files. Please fix the parsing to properly read in the time component as it was formatted. Please also update the user input handling in the CLI flow to account for the time component as well, but make sure it's optional for the user to specify a time.
