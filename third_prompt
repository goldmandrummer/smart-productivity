I want to be able to categorize the tasks with tags and we can use the macos's built-in tags by running a bit of shell script within this python app that uses the "tag" command (already installed locally from homebrew). Please be sure to update the prompts in the CLI flow to not only get the user input regarding CRUD for the tags on the tasks but also CRUD for the tags defined in macos's filesystem. Please also make sure the CLI prompts regarding the tagging are as easy to understand for the user as possible (without being excessively wordy, of course). Here is the README for the "tag" command https://github.com/jdberry/tag to make sure to use it correctly.
