We will have the following files:\n\n- `main.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will handle the user interaction and call the appropriate functions based on user input.\n- `task_manager.py`: This file will contain the `TaskManager` class which will handle all task related operations such as adding, updating, deleting tasks etc.\n- `task.py`: This file will contain the `Task` class which will represent a task.\n- `storage.py`: This file will contain the `Storage` class which will handle all file related operations such as reading and writing tasks to a file.\n- `requirements.txt`: This file will contain all the dependencies required for our project.\n\nLet's start by creating the `Task` class:\n\ntask.py\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n@dataclass\nclass Task:\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    due_date: datetime\n    duration: int\n    priority: int\n    is_recurring: bool\n```\n\nNext, we will create the `Storage` class:\n\nstorage.py\n```python\nimport json\nfrom typing import List\nfrom task import Task\n\nclass Storage:\n    def __init__(self, file_path: str):\n        self.file_path = file_path\n\n    def read_tasks(self) -> List[Task]:\n        with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:\n            tasks = json.load(file)\n            return [Task(**task) for task in tasks]\n\n    def write_tasks(self, tasks: List[Task]):\n        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:\n            json.dump([task.__dict__ for task in tasks], file)\n```\n\nNext, we will create the `TaskManager` class:\n\ntask_manager.py\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom task import Task\nfrom storage import Storage\n\nclass TaskManager:\n    def __init__(self, storage: Storage):\n        self.storage = storage\n        self.tasks = self.storage.read_tasks()\n\n    def add_task(self, task: Task):\n        self.tasks.append(task)\n        self.storage.write_tasks(self.tasks)\n\n    def update_task(self, task: Task):\n        for i, t in enumerate(self.tasks):\n            if t.id == task.id:\n                self.tasks[i] = task\n                self.storage.write_tasks(self.tasks)\n                return\n        raise ValueError(\"Task not found\")\n\n    def delete_task(self, task_id: int):\n        for i, t in enumerate(self.tasks):\n            if t.id == task_id:\n                del self.tasks[i]\n                self.storage.write_tasks(self.tasks)\n                return\n        raise ValueError(\"Task not found\")\n\n    def get_top_priority_tasks(self, count: int) -> List[Task]:\n        return sorted(self.tasks, key=lambda t: t.priority, reverse=True)[:count]\n```\n\nFinally, we will create the `main.py` file:\n\nmain.py\n```python\nfrom task_manager import TaskManager\nfrom task import Task\nfrom storage import Storage\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef main():\n    storage = Storage('tasks.json')\n    task_manager = TaskManager(storage)\n\n    while True:\n        top_tasks = task_manager.get_top_priority_tasks(3)\n        for task in top_tasks:\n            print(task)\n\n        print(\"1.
